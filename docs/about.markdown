I am a technology enthusiast and find computers to be like magic. I have always enjoyed playing around on a computer, no matter what I did. From playing games to writing my own software, everything that I did has been a lot of fun. I have learned a lot and spilled pieces of my knowledge here, as a means to help myself when I am in need but also others who are on the same path.

This blog contains technical guides and information on various topics related to software development, Linux administration, web security and more. I try to keep all the information up to date, making necessary changes when things need to be updated.

There are some silly stuff on the blog as well. Give it a try and prepare to be bored.

With the intention of helping myself even I come here after a few years, I have tried to be as beginner friendly as possible in my posts. I wish you all good luck and enjoy your time here.

Please contact me for any questions, queries, suggestions, doubts or recommendations.
